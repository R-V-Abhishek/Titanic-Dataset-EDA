# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis

This project contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the famous Titanic dataset, analyzing passenger survival patterns and characteristics.

## Files

- `Titanic.ipynb` - Main Jupyter notebook containing the EDA
- `train.csv` - Training dataset with passenger information and survival outcomes
- `test.csv` - Test dataset for predictions
- `gender_submission.csv` - Sample submission file
- `Titanic EDA Report.pdf` - Detailed analysis report

## Dataset Description

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including:
- Passenger demographics (age, gender, class)
- Ticket information (fare, cabin, embarked port)
- Survival outcomes (for training data)

## Analysis Highlights

The EDA explores various factors that may have influenced passenger survival rates, including:
- Gender and age distributions
- Passenger class analysis
- Fare and accommodation patterns
- Family relationships and group travel
